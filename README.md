# THE BAGMAN'S GAMBLE

The goal is to become The Bagman.

To become The Bagman, you must collect 5 rings.

You can’t earn rings, but you can make them.

Every 3 hoops is a ring.

To earn hoops, you must number battle your opponent to create 5 less than the sum of the previous round using alternating numbers greater than 2 but less than 10.

First round starts at 65.

If you go over the number, your opponent gets a hoop.

Once you have 5 rings, you can build a bag.

First to build their bag is The Bagman.

What makes it a gamble is that, every three turns, you can choose to wager hoops against your opponent or the house.

If you lose against the house, you owe double the wager.

If you go into -5 poverty, it’s game over and your opponent is The Bagman.
